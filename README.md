# 🌐 TRSSS-2025  
**The Recursive Social Simulation System**  
A web-based life simulation where language, memory, lineage, and behavior evolve over time — all in a single HTML page.

## 🚀 Features (as of TRSSS@1.0.2)
- 🧬 **Reproduction system** — entities can form generations and pass down traits
- 🗣️ **Revamped phonetic generator** — creates structured, evolving languages
- 🧠 **Memory simulation** — both short-term and long-term memory per entity
- 🌍 **Land generation** *(coming soon)* — procedural world structure
- 🧾 **Lineage tracking** — every person has ancestors and a traceable history
- 💬 **Consistent internal language** — individuals share, change, and inherit language rules
- ✨ **More to come...**
